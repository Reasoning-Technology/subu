  error can cause subu-mk-0 to leave the creating of a subu
  in an intermediate state.  Rather than bailing on some
  of the errors we need to clean up instead.  Perhaps the
  yet to be written subu-rm program will be resilent enough
  to do more general cleanup.

  subu-mk-0 only gives x privs via setfacl to subu on masteru home and on
  subuland.  Hence a subu can not run subu-mk-0 and be guaranteed access to the
  subu's newly made subu.  I.e. cd might not work for recurisve subu.

  The easy fix would be to use perms instead of facls, and give all home
  directories other 'x' privs.  Another fix would be to take apart the subu
  home path, and make sure that all sub paths have 'x'.

  For now, I'm just leaving it to one layer.
