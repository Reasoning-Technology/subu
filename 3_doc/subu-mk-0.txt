  If we allowed the subu_home directory to be put anywhere, this script could be
  used by masteru gain access to any directory on the system.  Hence, we have
  the following constraints:

    constraint 1) the subu_home directory must not already exist, not as a
    directory or as any other type of object. 

    constraint 2) masteru must have 'x' privledges to reach $(masteru_home)/subuland, and have
    permissions to create the subu_home subdirectory.

    constraint 3) subu_home may only be placed under the directory $(masteru_home)/subuland.

    convention 4) only subu_home directories may be placed in $(masteru_home)/subuland.

  -> without constraint 1), exploit 1

    Suppose that a wily masteru was able to move an inaccessible directory that he
    or she wanted access to and place it under $(masteru_home)/subuland.
    Typically such directories are not moveable to wiley users in the first place,
    but suppose the wily masteru found such a directory.

    Alternatively suppose the wily masteru made a directory under $(masteru_home)/subuland
    of his or her own, and placed an inaccessible file or subdirectory inside of it.

    Alternatively suppose that the wily masteru made $(masteru_home)/subuland a hard link
    or a symlink to a directory that contained a subdirectory that masteru did not have 
    access to.

    The the wiley masteru could create a subu by the same name as the directory he desired
    access to, and trick the foolish subu-mk-0 into giving him or her access.

  -> without constraint 2) exploit 2

    Then the masteru could place subu directories in places he can not access.
    The foolish subu-mk-0 program would then add 'x' acls to as to reach this place.
    The masteru could then change identity to the subu, (i.e. enter the container),
    and then reach that place he or she could not reach before.

  -> without constraint 3) exploit 3

  There is still a wrinkle. If masteru looses x privlege to a place, subu might keep
  it, and then exploit 2 would work despite the existence of constraint 2.  It would
  be unusual that masteru not have x privledges to masteru_home.  Furthmore, we 
  degree that masteru has x privige to subuland.  Hence, exploit 3 can be prevented
  by following simple accounting rules that are already normal.

  -> without convention 4) exploit 4

  Constraint 4 is a convention that masteru
