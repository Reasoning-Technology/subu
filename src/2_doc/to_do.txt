  error can cause subu-mk-0 to leave the creating of a subu in an intermediate
  state.  Rather than bailing on some of the errors we need to clean up instead.
  Perhaps the yet to be written subu-rm program will be resilent enough to do
  more general cleanup.

  need to modify subu-init to take a configuration file name argument instead of
  using a global variabel value.  might want to add arguments to other subu
  commands also

  want to add subu-type to masteru_subu(),  I imagine there will be static,
  permanent, and temporary subu types.

  the masteru subu relation should contain the uid of the masteru as
  well as the backup type for the subu:  git, rdiff, rsync, none.
  and the persisitance fo the subu: indefinite, session.
  seems that operations need to be logged, in case the db is lost
  the transcript can be played back.  It should also be possible
  to co-opt an existing user as a subu, though, would require
  sudo privs.
