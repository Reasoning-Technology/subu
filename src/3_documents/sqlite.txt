  This sql:

    char *sql = 
      "BEGIN TRANSACTION;"
      "UPDATE Key_Int SET value = value + 1 WHERE key = 'max_subu_number';"
      "SELECT value FROM Key_Int WHERE key = 'max_subu_number';"
      "COMMIT;"
      ;

  with sqlite_exec, the call back is called with the data from the select.

  with sqlite_prepare_v2, sqlite_step just returns SQLITE_DONE, and we never
  get to see our data from the select.
